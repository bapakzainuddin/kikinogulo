But did you know that Tina Fey created the hit show '30 Rock', and was earning $500,000 per episode?&nbsp; Here's what's more to know about one of the highest paid female comedians in showbiz.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=#>Tina Fey slammed over '30 Rock' blackface episodes, Internet says she's not sorry, 'she's just covering her a**'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Tina Fey has a great idea for bringing back '30 Rock' and 'Parks & Rec'</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/4c8fe7a5-d9e3-41ef-84de-b9ef74cb7200.1154863306><h2 class=split>What is Tina Fey's net worth?</h2><p>Tina Fey's net worth is billed at $75 million, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrtiy Net Worth</a>. After submitting several scripts into ‘Saturday Night Live’, Fey was hired as a writer in 1997, eventually becoming the head writer for SNL and the first female to achieve this position.&nbsp;</p><p>After gaining further popularity for writing the hit film 'Mean Girls', which grossed $130 million and remains a cult classic today, Fey left SNL for her own sitcom. She created and starred in '30 Rock', where she played Liz Lemon, the head writer of an NBC sketch comedy series. The show aired for seven seasons on the network and earned her her first acting Emmy win. The one-hour series finale of '30 Rock' pulled in 4.8 million viewers in January, 2013. Rave reviews from critics considered the show to be one of the best TV series of all time. Fey was reportedly paid a salary of $500,000 per episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/75216ecf-4119-481f-a5be-7ce956ede5d8.160207779><h2 class=split>Awards</h2><p>Fey has won nine Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, five Screen Actors Guild Awards, seven Writers Guild Awards, and three Producers Guild Awards. She been nominated for a Grammy Award (Best Spoken Word Album for 'Bossypants') and a Tony Award (Best Book of a Musical for 'Mean Girls').</p><p>In 2008, she received the AP Entertainer of the Year award from the Associated Press. In 2010, Fey was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, becoming the youngest-ever recipient of the award, and it was announced that she would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. In 2018, Fey received the Herb Sargent Award for Comedy Excellence from the Writers Guild of America together with frequent collaborator Robert Carlock. Tina's autobiography 'Bossypants' was massively popular and topped The New York Times Best Seller list for five weeks straight when it was first released.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Real estate, cars and jewelry</h2><p>Fey's income from book sales and her executive producing salary alone amounted to $13 million in 2011. She and her composer husband Jeff Richmond paid $1.9 million for a New York City apartment. In 2006, they paid $550,000 for a smaller condo nearby which Tina uses as an office.</p><p>In 2009 they purchased a $3.4 million apartment in the Upper West Side of New York City. They upgraded to a four-bedroom, two-fireplace pre-war co-op. The spacious pad had 4 bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, an eat-in kitchen and a library. The place had “a peek” of the Hudson River, and was only about a dozen-block walk downtown to 160 Riverside Drive, where many of the '30 Rock' character’s most memorable mishaps had taken place. Built in 1917, Fey now owns two of the 32 units in the co-op building.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/80e7608e-1af4-4675-80a2-20ed909d2e3a.jpeg><p>In January 2016, the New York Observer reported that Fey had purchased a $9.5 million apartment. The 10-room apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side is situated directly above the Riverside Drive home she currently shares with with husband Jeff Richmond and their two young daughters. The apartment was originally listed for $7.5 million but ended up selling for $2 million more than that. Instyle reported that it also has a master suite with a dressing room and three additional bedrooms, each of which includes its own marble-tiled bathroom. The home also boasts a private elevator landing and two fireplaces that are perfect for chilly New York evenings. There's lots of natural sunlight as the entire pad offers 22 windows.&nbsp;</p><p>Stopping by on Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' in December 2020, Fey said she bought a Subaru Forester. She said her husband urged her to buy something fun, like a Mini Cooper or a Jeep, but she instead, wanted "a car that looks like a medical sneaker" and one that is "so safe." The base 2021 Subaru Forester has an MSRP of $24,795.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2fc0ce94-79b6-4163-81a4-b78dca61fa3e.jpg><p>Tina Fey showed off an Atelier Versace gown with a 154-carat Bulgari sapphire and diamond necklace that belongs on the neck of the Duchess of Cambridge, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hollywood Gossip</a>, at the 88th Annual Academy Awards in 2016.
