Tell that to the hundreds of people rounded up by the FBI for just being in the vicinity of the Capitol on January 6, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry, nobody believes that the Biden administration cares about safeguarding civil liberties <a href=#>unless it’s part of a cover-up</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“They didn’t find anyone because they didn’t want to find anyone,” says former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik after the Secret Service declared that its joint investigation with the FBI had proved fruitless.&nbsp;</p><p>Shifting stories about where the cocaine was located add to the public skepticism, and then a flat-out lie about when the president and his son left the White House for Camp David that weekend compounded the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite enlisting the help of the FBI, the Secret Service found no fingerprints or DNA evidence on the bag of cocaine.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Secret Service concluded the investigation into the cocaine found in the White House without identifying a suspect. <span class=credit>REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">According to Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the agency didn’t have enough evidence to interview any of the potential suspects. <span class=credit>Getty Images/iStockphoto</span></figure><p>“So, whoever had the cocaine, they wore gloves? I doubt it,” scoffs Kerik. “And the fact they have changed the location three times makes it evident they are trying to conceal and suppress where it was actually found.”&nbsp;</p><p>Even more astonishing is that, in a complex bristling with security cameras, the Secret Service said no surveillance video footage exists because the baggie was located in a “blind spot.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t care if it was a six-foot blind spot,” says Kerik. “I can tell you who walked into it and who walked out of it. The whole blind spot argument is bogus.”&nbsp;</p><p>He claims the Secret Service knows exactly whose cocaine it is.&nbsp;</p><p>“They don’t miss anything. They know their job. They are very systematic, very organized, very thorough,” he said, adding, “The whole thing is preposterous. It’s really an insult to the men and women in the Secret Service and the FBI for them to say they can’t identify where the cocaine came from.”&nbsp;</p><p>As the mystery dragged on into its second week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to rule out that the cocaine belonged to a member of the Biden family and <a href=#>slammed the question as “incredibly irresponsible.”&nbsp;</a></p><p>She also falsely claimed that the president and his son were not at the White House two days before the cocaine was found.&nbsp;</p><p>“They were not here Friday. They were not here Saturday. They were not here Sunday. They were not even here Monday.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Hunter and Joe were indeed at the White House on Friday, until 6:34 p.m., when they flew off for a long weekend at Camp David.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">President Biden and his son Hunter leaving the White House for a long weekend at Camp David on June 30, 2023. <span class=credit>AP Photo/Susan Walsh</span></figure><p>Even former Russiagate federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann says the investigation is a joke, while not pointing the finger at either Biden.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s such bad law enforcement,” he told MSNBC, “and frankly, I would say suspicious.&nbsp;</p><p>“You interview people. But you know what you don’t do before you interview people? Publicly say that there’s no DNA evidence and no fingerprints. Like why would you let the whole world know that if you’re then going to interview people? Better for people to think that you might have that,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>But according to the Secret Service, there were just too many people to interview.</p><p>Anyway, cocaine possession is a misdemeanor in the District of Columbia, so basically who cares, shut up and stop asking questions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre incorrectly claimed that the Biden family wasn’t at the White House at all the weekend the cocaine was found. <span class=credit>Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>This blasé attitude is exactly the wrong message to be sending from the White House.&nbsp;</p><p>Nancy Reagan would be rolling in her grave.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as a misdemeanor, the penalty in DC is up to 180 days in jail.</p><p>Cocaine is a serious drug that impairs judgment and discourages secrecy.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the important work carried out in the White House, it is a national security problem if the staff are drugged out, and so sloppy that they leave their cocaine lying around.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Get Miranda's latest take</h3><p class=inline-module__cta>Sign up for Devine Online, the newsletter from Miranda Devine</p><p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Thanks for signing up!</h3></p><p>Donald Trump, who is more familiar with the White House than most people, <a href=#>told Fox News on Sunday</a>: “You know how many cameras they have opposite the front door of the Situation Room? [It’s] where you decide on war, where you decide on nuclear.”&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone with any knowledge of law enforcement or familiarity with the White House is skeptical about the Secret Service excuses.&nbsp;</p><p>A former senior Secret Service agent who has protected past presidents worries that the agency is “closing the investigation to take the Biden administration off the hook … I pray not, but I am suspicious that the Secret Service … took the road that it believed would generate the least criticism in the long term.”&nbsp;</p><p>He points out that Biden has a history of cozy relationships with the agency.</p><p>When the head of his Secret Service detail, Dale Pupillo, suffered a death in the family in 2009, then-VP Biden flew on Air Force Two to Indiana to attend the wake.</p><p>After Pupillo retired as assistant director, he continued to work for the Biden family in a private capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>Kimberly Cheatle, the current Secret Service director, appointed by Biden last year, also served on his vice presidential security detail.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Hunter Biden has been assisted by Secret Service agents in past mishaps. <span class=credit>REUTERS/Julia Nikhinson</span></figure><p>Hunter has been rescued from various drug-related scrapes by former and serving Secret Service agents.</p><p>From the crack pipe he left inside an Arizona rental car to his <a href=#>gun thrown in a trash can by his ex-lover Hallie Biden</a>, the Secret Service always seemed to arrive to clean up after him.&nbsp;</p><p>Hunter once told a friend, in a message left on his laptop, how his father leveraged favors through his Secret Service agents: “guys that he got their daughter into the naval academy that he had to the VP residence and let them use his apartment to stay and cost the White House, guys he paid their health insurance premiums for anonymously.”&nbsp;</p><p>If your job is to protect the president, how far do you go?&nbsp;</p><p>Kerik thinks eventually the truth will leak out because “the men and women in the federal law enforcement arena are sick and tired of having to conceal and suppress [and] basically commit crimes on behalf of the Biden White House.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmam5fqbWmedKemqudpGLApr7Vopqeq12eu7ex0q2goJmknryvec6nZK2glWKwsK%2FAoqWeZZakwq%2BwjKKlZqyYmnq4tMitnGagn6rApnnBpaawq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-secret-services-investigation-on-the-cocaine-found-in-the-white-house-blows.html&text=The%20Secret%20Service%27s%20investigation%20on%20the%20cocaine%20found%20in%20the%20White%20House%20blows&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-secret-services-investigation-on-the-cocaine-found-in-the-white-house-blows.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-secret-services-investigation-on-the-cocaine-found-in-the-white-house-blows.html&title=The%20Secret%20Service%27s%20investigation%20on%20the%20cocaine%20found%20in%20the%20White%20House%20blows" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-secret-services-investigation-on-the-cocaine-found-in-the-white-house-blows.html&title=The%20Secret%20Service%27s%20investigation%20on%20the%20cocaine%20found%20in%20the%20White%20House%20blows" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-secret-services-investigation-on-the-cocaine-found-in-the-white-house-blows.html&title=The%20Secret%20Service%27s%20investigation%20on%20the%20cocaine%20found%20in%20the%20White%20House%20blows" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-secret-services-investigation-on-the-cocaine-found-in-the-white-house-blows.html&description=The%20Secret%20Service%27s%20investigation%20on%20the%20cocaine%20found%20in%20the%20White%20House%20blows" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./was-angela-tian-fired-late-child-rapper-lil-tays-mom-claims-she-resigned-from-real-estate-job-for-daughters-future.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was Angela Tian fired?
