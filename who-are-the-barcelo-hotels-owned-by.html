But who actually owns this upscale Spanish hotel chain?</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we’ll look at the origins of the Barceló family business and how their ownership structure has evolved over nine decades in the travel industry.</p><p>If you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer: <b>Barceló hotels and resorts are privately owned by the members of the Barceló family, descendants of founder Simón Barceló who started the company in Mallorca, Spain in 1931</b>.</p><h2>History and Origins</h2><h3>Founded in 1931 by Simón Barceló Oliver in Mallorca, Spain</h3><p>The story of Barceló Hotels begins in 1931 when Simón Barceló Oliver founded the company in Mallorca, Spain. It all started as a small transportation company called Autocares Barceló, providing transportation services to locals and tourists alike.</p><p>Simón Barceló Oliver had a vision to create a company that would not only transport people but also offer exceptional hospitality services.</p><h3>Began as a small transportation company called Autocares Barceló</h3><p>Autocares Barceló quickly gained a reputation for its excellent service and attention to detail. The company grew steadily, expanding its fleet of vehicles and establishing a strong presence in the transportation industry.</p><p>However, Simón Barceló Oliver saw an opportunity to further expand the business and venture into the tourism sector.</p><h3>Expanded into tourism services and hotel ownership in the 1950s-60s</h3><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Barceló Hotels underwent a significant transformation. The company expanded its operations to include tourism services, such as tour guides, excursions, and travel packages. This expansion allowed Barceló to cater to a wider range of travelers and offer a complete vacation experience.</p><p>During this period, Barceló Hotels also made its foray into hotel ownership. The company acquired its first hotel in Mallorca, marking the beginning of a new era for the brand. Over the years, Barceló Hotels continued to acquire and develop properties in popular tourist destinations around the world.</p><p>Today, Barceló Hotels is a globally recognized brand with a presence in over 20 countries. With a portfolio of more than 250 hotels, the company continues to uphold its commitment to providing exceptional hospitality experiences to its guests.</p><h2>Second Generation Ownership</h2><p>After the successful establishment of Barceló Hotels by Simón Barceló, the company saw a smooth transition into the hands of his sons, Miguel and Gabriel, in the 1970s-80s. This marked the beginning of the second generation ownership of the Barceló Hotels.</p><h3>Led by Simón Barceló’s sons Miguel and Gabriel in the 1970s-80s</h3><p>Miguel and Gabriel Barceló took over the reins of the company and continued to build upon their father’s legacy. They brought fresh ideas and innovation to the table, ensuring that the Barceló brand remained at the forefront of the hospitality industry.</p><h3>Purchased existing hotels and built new resort properties</h3><p>Under the leadership of Miguel and Gabriel, Barceló Hotels expanded its portfolio by acquiring existing hotels and also constructing new resort properties. This strategic move allowed them to cater to a wider range of customers and increase their presence in popular tourist destinations.</p><p>The brothers carefully selected prime locations for their new resorts, ensuring that guests could enjoy stunning views, luxurious amenities, and an unforgettable vacation experience.</p><h3>Extended the Barceló brand into other Spanish vacation destinations</h3><p>In addition to expanding their presence in existing locations, the Barceló brothers extended the Barceló brand into other Spanish vacation destinations. This move allowed them to tap into new markets and attract a diverse clientele.</p><p>By leveraging their expertise and reputation, Miguel and Gabriel successfully established Barceló Hotels as a leading name in the hospitality industry, not only in their original locations but also in new and exciting destinations.</p><p>Today, Barceló Hotels continues to thrive under the leadership of the Barceló family, with Miguel and Gabriel’s children actively involved in the business. Their commitment to excellence and innovation has ensured that the Barceló brand remains synonymous with exceptional hospitality and unforgettable experiences.</p><h2>Third Generation and Beyond</h2><p>Barceló Hotels, a renowned hospitality brand, is currently managed by Simón Barceló Tous, who belongs to the third generation of the Barceló family.

This beautiful city, located in the Balearic Islands, serves as the central hub for the brand’s operations.</p><p>The headquarters in Palma de Mallorca reflects the Barceló family’s deep connection to their roots and their commitment to maintaining their Spanish heritage.</p><h3>Expanded globally through acquisitions and joint ventures</h3><p>Over the years, Barceló Hotels has expanded its reach globally through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.
