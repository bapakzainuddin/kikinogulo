He plays for the <i>Brooklyn Nets</i> of the NBA as a Point Guard. The 28-year-old has been serving as vice president of the National Basketball Players Association since <i>February 2020</i>. Previously, Irving played for <i>Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics</i>, and college basketball for the <i>Duke Blue Devils</i>.</p><p>Kyrie Andrew Irving was born on <i>March 23, 1992</i>, in Melbourne, Australia. He was born to <strong>Drederick Irving</strong> (father) and the late <strong>Elizabeth Irving</strong> (mother). Kyrie has an older sister <strong>Asia</strong> along with a younger sister, <strong>London</strong>. Irving relocated to the U.S when he was two years old. Besides, he holds dual citizenship of American and Australia.</p><h2>Kyrie Irving engaged to Marlene Wilkerson</h2><p>The 28-year-old basketball star is reportedly engaged to <strong>Marlene Wilkerson</strong>, a gorgeous fashion model, and entrepreneur. Still, the news of their engagement is extremely low-profile. The couple has been <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>together</strong></a> since <i>December 2018</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/23/KyrieMarlene-1608718618009.jpg><p>In <i>September 2019</i>, Marlene was spotted with a beautiful engagement ring. Irving secretly proposed to her in an undisclosed location. However, it is not known if Kyrie and Marlene aka Golden will tie their knot anytime soon.</p><h3>Are Kyrie and Marlene still together?</h3><p>There haven't been any confirmations, but it seems things aren't going well between Irving and Wilkerson. The speculation of their split first appeared after Irving deleted all the posts dedicated to Marlene on his social media. Likewise, Wilkerson has unfollowed Kyrie on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/23/Marlene-1608718841044.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Marlene hasn't been wearing her engagement ring. Therefore, we can say that the couple's relationship is on the cliff. As per rumors, the NBA star cheated on his fiancee. Additionally, Kyrie and Marlene haven't spoken publicly about their current relationship status.</p><h2>Shares a Daughter with Former Miss Texas USA</h2><p>Kyrie began dating the 2010 Miss Texas USA, <strong>Andrea Wilson</strong> in early 2013. Within two years, Wilson gave birth to a daughter named, <strong>Azurie Elizabeth</strong> in <i>November 2015</i>. However, Kyrie and Andrea had separated before the birth of their child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/23/AndreaAzurie-1608719094873.jpg><p>Further, Irving asked for a paternity test and agreed to support his daughter's welfare including her education and expenses. He also agreed to spousal support. Irving doesn't make a public appearance with his daughter, unlike <a href=#><strong>Stephen Curry</strong></a> makes with his daughter, <a href=#><strong>Riley Curry</strong></a>.</p><h2>Kyrie Irving Past Relationships</h2><p>After separating from Andrea, Kyrie began a series of short-lived relationship with different women. The basketball player confirmed his romance with R&B singer, <strong>Kehlani Parrish </strong>in <i>January 2016</i>.</p><p>Two months later, <strong>PartyNextDoor</strong>, a Canadian musician posted a picture on Instagram where he and Parrish were in bed together. The picture caused controversy on Twitter, where Kehlani was abused for cheating on Kyrie. The R&B singer explained that no one was cheated on. Later in 2018, Kyrie defended his ex by posting an apology via Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/23/IrvingKeh-1608719292751.jpg><p>Moreover, Irving has dated or has been linked up with <strong>Gabrielle Lexa</strong>, <strong>Chantel Jeffries</strong>, <strong>Natalia Garibotto</strong>, <strong>Callie Rivers</strong>, and <strong>Ashley Bishop</strong>.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The 6 feet 2-inch six-time All-Star, Kyrie Irving has a net worth of <strong>$90 million</strong> as per celebrity net worth. The majority of Irving's wealth comes from his lucrative endorsements and salaries.</p><p>In 2019, Kyrie signed a four-year contract worth <strong>$136,490,600</strong>, where his annual average salary is <strong>$34,122,650</strong>. Including his 2021 annual salary, Irving's career earning is estimated at <strong>$158,294,849</strong>.</p><p>Previously in 2014, Kyrie signed a five-year deal worth <strong>$90 million</strong> with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Besides earning a hefty sum of money from his basketball career, Irving is also active on youth welfare. He launched a <strong>$1.5 million</strong> fund to help players opting out of the WNBA restart.</p><h2>Endorsements</h2><p>From 2017-2020, Kyrie Irving has earned <strong>$119 million</strong> from salary and endorsements. He has endorsement deals with big brands such as Pepsi, Skullcandy, Nike, etc. Irving's endorsement with Nike is worth <strong>$11 million</strong>. If you don't know, <a href=#><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></a>'s shoe deal is still the biggest one in NBA history.</p><p>Irving has also appeared in several Pepsi Max commercials. In 2012, he debuted in the first <i>"Uncle Drew"</i> commercials. Irving portrayed the character in the 2018 feature film, Uncle Drew with former NBA stars <strong>Shaquille O'Neal</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Reggie Miller</strong></a>, and <strong>Chris Webber</strong>.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Kyrie's father, Drederick played basketball, while his late mother, Elizabeth was a member of the volleyball team. His parents met while attending Boston University. Sadly, Elizabeth unexpectedly died at 29 after contracting sepsis.</p><p><i><strong>Kyrie Irving Highlights!</strong></i></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Talking about Kyrie's professional career, Cleveland Cavaliers selected him with the No. 1 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Likewise, in 2016, he teamed with <a href=#><strong>LeBron James</strong></a> and the Cavaliers won their first championship in franchise history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqSwq6GVYrazwsinng%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkyrie-irving.html&text=NBA%20player%2c%20Kyrie%20Irving%20whose%20net%20worth%20is%20%2490%20million%20has%20a%20daughter.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkyrie-irving.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkyrie-irving.html&title=NBA%20player%2c%20Kyrie%20Irving%20whose%20net%20worth%20is%20%2490%20million%20has%20a%20daughter." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkyrie-irving.html&title=NBA%20player%2c%20Kyrie%20Irving%20whose%20net%20worth%20is%20%2490%20million%20has%20a%20daughter." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkyrie-irving.html&title=NBA%20player%2c%20Kyrie%20Irving%20whose%20net%20worth%20is%20%2490%20million%20has%20a%20daughter." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkyrie-irving.html&description=NBA%20player%2c%20Kyrie%20Irving%20whose%20net%20worth%20is%20%2490%20million%20has%20a%20daughter." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./polina-menshikh-wikipedia-age.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Polina Menshikh Wikipedia And Age: How Old Was The Russian Actress?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./max-baer-jr.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Max Baer Jr.">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
