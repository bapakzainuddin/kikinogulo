Talking about his <strong>nationality,</strong> he holds an American identity.</p><p>His family has run a salvage yard on their 40-acre (16 ha) property outside of town in rural Gibson, Wisconsin, since 1965. Chuck, Earl, and Barb are Avery’s three siblings.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=In_which_school_did_Steven_Avery_attend></span>In which school did Steven Avery attend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He went to public schools in nearby Mishicot and Manitowoc, where his mother claimed he attended an elementary school “for slower kids.”</p><p>According to one of his attorneys in 1985, school records revealed that his IQ was 70 and that he “barely functioned in school.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Steven_Avery-_Professional_Life_Careers></span>Steven Avery- Professional Life, Careers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Avery, the subject of the hit Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer, was the victim of a wrongful sexual assault conviction in 1985, which led to him serving 18 years in prison.</p><p>He was set free in September 2003 but was convicted of the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach in 2007.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Convictions></span><span>Early Convictions</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Avery was convicted of burglarizing a bar with a friend in March 1981, when he was 18 years old.</p><p>He was released on probation and ordered to pay restitution after serving ten months of a two-year sentence in the Manitowoc County Jail.</p><p>In late 1982, two men admitted that they threw Avery’s cat “in a bonfire and then watched it burn until it died” after Avery had poured gas and oil on it.</p><p>Avery was found guilty of animal cruelty and sentenced to prison until August 1983.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wrongful_attempted_sexual_assault_conviction></span><span>Wrongful attempted sexual assault conviction</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A woman was brutally attacked and sexually assaulted while jogging on a Lake Michigan beach in July 1985. Avery was caught after the victim chose him from a photo lineup and then from a live lineup.</p><p>Despite the fact that Avery was forty miles away in Green Bay shortly after the attack – an alibi supported by a time-stamped store receipt and sixteen eyewitnesses – he was charged, convicted, and sentenced to thirty-two years in prison for rape and attempted murder. Higher courts rejected appeals in 1987 and 1996.</p><p>Avery’s wrongful conviction case attracted widespread attention. Rep. Mark Gundrum, the Republican chairman of the Wisconsin Assembly Judiciary Committee, impaneled a bipartisan task force to recommend improvements to the state’s criminal justice system aimed at decreasing the likelihood of future wrongful convictions.</p><p>Recommendations included a revamped eyewitness identification protocol&nbsp;and new guidelines for interrogations of suspects and witnesses, and the collection and storage of material evidence.</p><p>The recommendations were ultimately drafted into legislation that became known as the Avery Bill, which was passed and signed in October 2005,&nbsp;then renamed the Criminal Justice Reform Bill a month later after Avery was charged in the Halbach case.</p><p>Avery filed a civil lawsuit against Manitowoc County, its former sheriff, Thomas Kocourek, and its former district attorney, Denis Vogel, seeking $36 million in wrongful conviction damages. Following his murder indictment, the suit was settled for $400,000 in February 2006.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Teresa_Halbach_Murder></span><span>Teresa Halbach Murder</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Teresa Halbach, a photographer, went missing on October 31, 2005; her last alleged appointment was a meeting with Avery at his home near the grounds of Avery’s Auto Salvage to photograph his sister’s minivan that he was offering for sale on Autotrader.com.</p><p>Halbach’s car was discovered partially hidden in the salvage yard, and bloodstains found inside matched Avery’s DNA.</p><p>Charred bone fragments discovered in a burn pit near Avery’s home were later identified as Halbach’s.</p><p>On November 11, 2005, Avery was arrested and charged with Halbach’s murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, and mutilation of a dead body.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Prosecution></span><span>Prosecution</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Steven Avery was the only one of the Innocence Project’s 174 exonerees to be charged with a violent crime after their release as of May 2006.</p><p>On March 18, Avery was found guilty of&nbsp;first-degree murder and illegal possession of a firearm and was acquitted on the corpse-mutilation charge.</p><p>He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on the murder conviction, plus five years on the weapons charge, to run concurrently.</p><p>Avery was transferred to the Waupun Correctional Institution in Waupun in 2012 after serving five years at the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility in Boscobel.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Petition></span><span>Petition</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On December 20, 2015, a petition titled “Investigate and pardon the Averys in Wisconsin and punish the corrupt officials who railroaded these innocent men” was created on a White House petitioning site. A White House spokesperson stated in a January 2016 response to the petition that since Avery and Dassey “Because they are both state inmates, the President cannot pardon them.</p><p>In this case, the appropriate authorities at the state level would need to issue a pardon.” Walker will not pardon Avery, according to a spokesman for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Steven_Avery-_Net_worth_Salary></span>Steven Avery- Net worth, Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Steven Avery has an estimated <strong>net worth</strong> of <strong>around $500thousand.</strong> However, his exact income, salary, and earnings are not disclosed yet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_tall_is_Steven_Avery></span>How tall is Steven Avery?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Steven Avery stands tall at a <strong>height of</strong>&nbsp;<strong>6 feet</strong> and <strong>weighs around 98 kg</strong>.
