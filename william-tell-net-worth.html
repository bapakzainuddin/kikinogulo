According to authoritative sources, Tell has net worth of over $5 million, accumulated from his career in the previously mentioned field.</p><h3>William Tell Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Tell was always interested in music, as he shared that interest with his father, from whom he learned how to play guitar. However, he rose to fame when he joined the piano rock band Something Corporate after he had met its members through a mutual friend. Subsequently, in 2001 he officially joined the band and signed a contract with Drive Thru Records. He was a member when they released their first major album ‘’Leaving through the Window’’ in 2002 which featured 14 songs such as ‘’I Want To Save You’’ and ‘’Punk Rock Princess’’, achieving notable success by peaking at number one on the Top Heatseekers Chart, and after that the band released a home video ‘’A Year in the Life’’ in November of the same year. Their net worth was well established.</p><p>In October 2003, Something Corporate worked on another major album, ‘’North’’, which received a mostly positive response from critics and the audience, and was said to be ‘’thoughtful ruminations on love, celebrity, and the steady approach of adulthood’’, as music critic Andrew Leahey described it. ‘’North’’ consisted of 12 singles including ‘’As You Sleep’’, ‘’Space’’ and ‘’Down’’, with the majority of the songs written by <a href=#>Andrew McMahon</a>, Tell’s band mate. The band launched the album with an appearance in ‘’<a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live’’, one of the most popular American talk shows. ‘’North’’ sold more than 41,000 copies in the first week of its release, and ultimately charted at number 24 in the US, whereas it took the 152nd place in the UK. By March 2005, the album had sold 330,000 copies in the US, however, the members of the band stated that they thought of ‘’North’’ as a failure and added that they thought it wasn’t as successful as it should have been since they put so much effort into making it.</p><p>However, in 2004, it was announced that Tell had left the band to pursue his solo career, and in that manner he made his first solo release entitled ‘’You Can’t Hold Me Down’’ in 2007, and then followed with the release of the full album of the same title; it featured 10 tracks, but also had some bonus tracks on iTunes and BestBuy.</p><p>In 2014, William graduated from USC Gould School Law, but nevertheless, doesn’t yet work as a lawyer.</p><p>When it comes to his private life, he is married to <a href=#>Lauren Conrad</a>, a television persona from the hit series ‘’The Hills’’. The couple got engaged in 2013, married in 2014 and had their first child, William ‘’Liam’’ in 2017.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjrCgpaSZlrpuwMSlo2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwilliam-tell-net-worth.html&text=William%20Tell%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwilliam-tell-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwilliam-tell-net-worth.html&title=William%20Tell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwilliam-tell-net-worth.html&title=William%20Tell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwilliam-tell-net-worth.html&title=William%20Tell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwilliam-tell-net-worth.html&description=William%20Tell%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./snl-mocks-trumps-major-nft-trading-card-announcement.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'SNL' mocks Trumps 'major' NFT trading card announcement">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jacida-carter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Lil Wayne's Mother, Jacinda Carter Married To?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
