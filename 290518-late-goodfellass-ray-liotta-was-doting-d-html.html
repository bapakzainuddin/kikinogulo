Ray's films were characterized by intensity and a villainous essence.</p><p class=Fg>In real life, Liotta's story carried as much intensity and drama. The star was born in Newark, New Jersey, and spent the first months of his life at an orphanage.</p><p class=Fg>Ray's birth mother had abandoned him at the orphanage at birth, and six months later, a couple, Mary Edgar and Alfred Liotta <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000501/bio>adopted</a> him. One of Ray's earliest memories was visiting an orphanage to adopt his sister, Linda.</p><p class=Fg>His mother was a clerk, while his dad owned an automotive business. Later in life, the couple ventured into politics and ran for local office several times. However, they never got into office.</p><p class=Fg>As a child, Ray loved sports and played games, including baseball, basketball, and pretend army. He also thought he would grow up to be a construction worker.</p><p class=Fg>After high school, Ray attended Miami University, where he bagged a degree in acting. He forged his acting career, making friends with actors like Steven Bauer and appearing in films including "Something Wild," "Dominick and Eugene," and "Field of Dreams."</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>HOW ADOPTION IMPACTED LIOTTA</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/215157bd3c2f0e0da3d9e49640ba9289.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Ray Liotta discusses "Marriage Story" with the Build Series at Build Studio on November 8, 2019 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Ray had a relatively regular childhood life with his parents but could not quite shake off the thoughts of being adopted.
