The couple was looking to expand their family when they first appeared on the show. They wanted to marry Roberta, a Brazilian but Roberta could not move to the United States unless she had a K-1 visa. In other to get that, Garrick would have to marry Roberta legally.</p><p>For that to happen, Dannielle had to file for a divorce from Garrick. So while they were not legally married, they were spiritually married.</p><p>By the time the family returned for season 4, they were looking forward to adding a woman called Lea into their brood. Unfortunately, the relationship with Lea did not work out as expected.&nbsp;Also, Garrick’s Brazilian wife broke up with the family via text message.</p><p>As of 2022, the Merrields are already dating a mystery Mexican woman whom they have plans of meeting later in the year.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_The_Joneses></span><strong>2.

The new sister wife, Donna joined the family with her daughter Evelyn. That same year, Sharis revealed to their fans that she was pregnant with her daughter, Chloe Vienna Esther Alldredge.</p><p>Later on June 2, 2021, the reality TV family revealed via social media that they had been physically separated from Donna.

However, the marriage ended after 10 years. While they were separated for a while, Marcus met Inda Epps, and they even got engaged.</p><p>Interestingly, Taryn decided to reconcile with Marcus and so she moved back. Marcus on the other hand did not want to lose India so he suggested that they start a polygamous family and the women all agreed.</p><p>The family made their debut on the show in season 4. During the show, two potential sister wives Bina and Janae were introduced. But before the end of the season, the family revealed they wanted to end the relationship with the two women.</p><p>Meanwhile, it was later revealed that Marcus continued dating both Bina and Janae even when his wives thought he had ended the relationship. Moreso, reports revealed that he had been dating other women as well. Although he already had plans to marry India in November 2022, Marcus was dating different women in-between time.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=7_The_Davis_Family></span><strong>7.

Nick Davis, the family patriarch was not legally married to either of his two wives April and Jennifer. Instead, April Davis and Jennifer Davis were legally married to each other before they got involved with Nick and so decided to take his last name.</p><p>The trio made their debut on season 4 of Seeking Sister Wife&nbsp;with the intention of adding a third wife to their brood. Nick then courted a woman called Danielle and later proposed to her.</p><p>In the season 4 finale, the family revealed that Jennifer and Nick welcomed their first baby together on June 29, 2022.

The Foleys</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p></p><p>Steve Foley was already married to an unnamed woman when he decided to adopt the plural lifestyle with Brenda. Since the first wife did not buy the idea she filed for divorce and so Steve married Brenda who now became his first wife.</p><p>When the Foleys joined the show in season 4, they were courting a woman called April. Although April and Brenda had issues in the relationship, reports say they have moved past that are working on building a happy family together.</p><p>In an Update of the season 4 finale, it was revealed that Steve and Brenda were dating Steve’s high school prom date, as a new potential sister wife.</p><p><b><p>While these families are still together as of the time of this writing, it is uncertain if they would all be featured in season 5 of the show. As for families that expanded in season 4, it is expected that they would be featured. There are speculations that new families might be introduced as well.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>TLC show</a> averaged around 600,000 viewers per episode in season 4 and it has remained one of the top 10 shows on TLC. While there is no news about season 5 yet, it is safe to assume that the plural relationships on the show would increase since several families from the previous seasons did not make it to the just concluded season.</p></b></p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kwKaxyqKloGWjnsC1sdFmrqKelWKwsMHPpZysZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fseeking-sister-wife-couples.html&text=Couples%20Still%20Together%20And%20Strong&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fseeking-sister-wife-couples.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fseeking-sister-wife-couples.html&title=Couples%20Still%20Together%20And%20Strong" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fseeking-sister-wife-couples.html&title=Couples%20Still%20Together%20And%20Strong" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fseeking-sister-wife-couples.html&title=Couples%20Still%20Together%20And%20Strong" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fseeking-sister-wife-couples.html&description=Couples%20Still%20Together%20And%20Strong" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dustin-diamond-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dustin Diamond  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./234102-chris-browns-mom-joyce-hawkins-shows-mak-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Brown's Mom Joyce Hawkins Shows off a Makeup-Free Selfie  See Fan Reactions">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
