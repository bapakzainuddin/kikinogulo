He is the founder and senior pastor of The Potter’s House, a non-denominational megachurch in Dallas, Texas. He is also an author, filmmaker, and motivational speaker who has touched millions of lives with his messages of hope, faith, and love.</p><p>However, in recent times, there have been rumors circulating on social media that TD Jakes has passed away. These rumors have caused confusion and distress among his followers and admirers. Is there any truth to these claims? Or are they just another example of fake news and misinformation?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Origin of the Death Hoax</strong></h3><p>The death hoax about TD Jakes seems to have originated from a YouTube video that was uploaded on September 26th 2022. The video claimed that TD Jakes had died suddenly at the age of 66. The video showed a picture of TD Jakes with a caption that read “RIP Bishop T.D. Jakes”. The video also had a voice-over that narrated the supposed details of his death.</p><p>The video claimed that TD Jakes had suffered a heart attack while preaching at his church. It said that he was rushed to the hospital but could not be revived. It also said that his wife, Serita Jakes, and his children were by his side when he passed away.</p><p>The video did not provide any source or evidence for its claims. It also had several grammatical and factual errors. For example, it said that TD Jakes was born in 1956, when in fact he was born in 1957. It also said that he had five children, when in fact he has six.</p><p>The video quickly went viral on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. Many people shared the video without verifying its authenticity. Some people expressed their shock and sadness over the news, while others questioned its validity.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Debunking of the Death Hoax</strong></h3><p>However, the rumor of TD Jakes’ death was soon debunked by several reputable sources and authorities. First of all, TD Jakes himself posted a tweet on his official Twitter account on September 26th 2022, which showed him alive and well. He wrote:</p><p>I’m alive and well! God bless you all! Thank you for your concern! Please don’t believe false information! #ImAlive</p><p>He also posted a video on his Instagram account on the same day, where he addressed the death hoax and thanked his fans for their prayers and support. He said:</p><p>Hello everybody! I’m Bishop T.D. Jakes and I’m alive! I’m alive! I’m alive! And I’m well! And I’m grateful to God for your prayers and your support and your love! And I want to thank you for being concerned about me! But please don’t believe everything you hear on social media!</p><p>He also urged his followers to be careful about what they share online and to check the facts before spreading rumors.</p><p>Secondly, several credible news outlets and websites also confirmed that TD Jakes was alive and well. They reported that the YouTube video was a hoax and that there was no truth to it. They also warned their readers not to fall for such scams and hoaxes.</p><p>Thirdly, several prominent figures and celebrities who are close to TD Jakes also came out to defend him and dispel the rumors. They posted messages on their social media accounts to show their support and solidarity with him. They also praised him for his ministry and his impact on the world.</p><p>Some of these figures include:</p><ul><li>Oprah Winfrey, who called him “a friend, mentor, brother” and said that he was “one of the greatest spiritual leaders of our time”.</li><li>Tyler Perry, who called him “a father figure” and said that he was “a blessing to millions”.</li><li>Joel Osteen, who called him “a brother” and said that he was “a man of God who loves people”.</li><li>Joyce Meyer, who called him “a friend” and said that he was “a powerful voice for the kingdom”.</li><li>Kirk Franklin, who called him “a legend” and said that he was “a gift to this generation”.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Motive Behind the Death Hoax</strong></h3><p>The motive behind the death hoax about TD Jakes is not clear. However, some possible reasons could be:</p><ul><li>To gain attention and views: Some people may create such hoaxes to attract attention and views to their YouTube channels or social media accounts. They may hope to generate revenue or fame from such sensationalized content.</li><li>To cause harm and damage: Some people may create such hoaxes to cause harm and damage to TD Jakes or his ministry. They may have a personal grudge or an ideological agenda against him or his beliefs.</li><li>To test people’s gullibility and reactions: Some people may create such hoaxes to test people’s gullibility and reactions. They may want to see how easily people believe and share false information. They may also want to see how people react emotionally and spiritually to such news.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Conclusion</strong></h3><p>In conclusion, the rumor that TD Jakes passed away is false and baseless. It is a hoax that was created by a YouTube video that had no source or evidence. It was debunked by TD Jakes himself, several reputable sources, and several prominent figures. TD Jakes is alive and well, and he continues to serve God and humanity with his ministry and his message.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to be careful and vigilant about what we see and hear online. We should not believe everything we see or hear without verifying its authenticity. We should also not share or spread false information that can cause confusion and distress. We should always check the facts before we act.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfqbFutsCknKxloJbAtLHDZpiwmaliwamxjK2prqyYYq%2BmtMinm2asmJp6pbHArZ9moJ%2BWxXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftd-jakes-passed-away-the-truth-behind-the-death-hoax.html&text=TD%20Jakes%20Passed%20Away%3a%20The%20Truth%20Behind%20the%20Death%20Hoax&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftd-jakes-passed-away-the-truth-behind-the-death-hoax.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftd-jakes-passed-away-the-truth-behind-the-death-hoax.html&title=TD%20Jakes%20Passed%20Away%3a%20The%20Truth%20Behind%20the%20Death%20Hoax" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftd-jakes-passed-away-the-truth-behind-the-death-hoax.html&title=TD%20Jakes%20Passed%20Away%3a%20The%20Truth%20Behind%20the%20Death%20Hoax" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftd-jakes-passed-away-the-truth-behind-the-death-hoax.html&title=TD%20Jakes%20Passed%20Away%3a%20The%20Truth%20Behind%20the%20Death%20Hoax" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftd-jakes-passed-away-the-truth-behind-the-death-hoax.html&description=TD%20Jakes%20Passed%20Away%3a%20The%20Truth%20Behind%20the%20Death%20Hoax" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tracy-morgan-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tracy Morgan Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./starting-pay-for-idaho-teachers-raised-to-40000.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Starting pay for Idaho teachers raised to $40,000">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
