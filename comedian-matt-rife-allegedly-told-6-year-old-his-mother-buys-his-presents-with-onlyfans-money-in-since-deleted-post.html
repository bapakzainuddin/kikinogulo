You are in complete control of how your future turns out,” Rife said. “It has nothing to do with stars, man. Just because Jupiter has a ring and you don’t, doesn’t mean that’s what you’re supposed to look up to for this magical advice.”</p><p>Towards the beginning of his special, Rife told the story of eating at a Baltimore restaurant with a friend when they noticed their female server had a black eye.</p><p>They questioned why the restaurant owners wouldn’t have the employee work in the kitchen to avoid customers asking questions.</p><p>“Yeah, but I feel like if she could cook, she wouldn’t have a black eye,”&nbsp;Rife joked.</p><p>He then told the crowd the story was “testing the waters” to see if they were fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/natural-selection-matt-rife-dar-72664256.jpg><p>“I figure if we start the show with domestic violence, the rest of the show should be smooth sailing,” he added.</p><p>Following&nbsp;online backlash,&nbsp;Rife put out a statement, directing social media users to a link offering an “apology” if they had ever been offended by a joke he told. The link brought users to a website where they could purchase special needs helmets.</p><p>Hedaya’s son reacted to the astrology and domestic violence on TikTok.</p><p>“Actually, it’s Saturn that has the rings. It has more [visible rings] also,” her son said. “And you’re mean to girls.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>The criticism allegedly drew the attention of Rife, who replied to the boy in a since-deleted Instagram message.</p><p>“Jupiter also has [a] ring. OH!… and Santa [Claus] isn’t real. Your mom buys you presents with the money she makes on OnlyFans. Good luck,” Rife wrote.</p><p>Hedaya denied Rife’s OnlyFans claim and said the comedian cannot “accept the fact that people may like women for their personalities.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/rife-tiktok.jpg><p>Under her video, many TikTok accounts rushed to her defense and suggested that Rife could not take a joke.</p><p>“Matt Rife is behaving more like a six-year-old than an actual six-year-old. Love it,” one user replied. “Your son is adorable and you are beautiful. Keep slaying!”</p><p>“He just digs himself deeper. What kind of ‘man’ beefs with a literal child???” another account chimed in.</p><p>Rife’s team did not return&nbsp;Fox News Digital’s&nbsp;request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmampfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvCqKSenJmWu265wK2rZqqZm7JurculnKCdlKHGbsDOpZtmbl2usqK%2BjKijnWWYnsBuuc6tn56qXZfCur%2BMoaCsZaCnsrSxza2qZq%2BZqbVuu82lsJ%2BZnqh6rrvNnrBmoZ5iwKq6wp5knZ2cmsGmsIyppqysXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcomedian-matt-rife-allegedly-told-6-year-old-his-mother-buys-his-presents-with-onlyfans-money-in-since-deleted-post.html&text=Comedian%20Matt%20Rife%20allegedly%20told%206-year-old%20his%20mother%20buys%20his%20presents%20with%20OnlyFans%20money%20in%20sin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcomedian-matt-rife-allegedly-told-6-year-old-his-mother-buys-his-presents-with-onlyfans-money-in-since-deleted-post.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcomedian-matt-rife-allegedly-told-6-year-old-his-mother-buys-his-presents-with-onlyfans-money-in-since-deleted-post.html&title=Comedian%20Matt%20Rife%20allegedly%20told%206-year-old%20his%20mother%20buys%20his%20presents%20with%20OnlyFans%20money%20in%20sin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcomedian-matt-rife-allegedly-told-6-year-old-his-mother-buys-his-presents-with-onlyfans-money-in-since-deleted-post.html&title=Comedian%20Matt%20Rife%20allegedly%20told%206-year-old%20his%20mother%20buys%20his%20presents%20with%20OnlyFans%20money%20in%20sin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcomedian-matt-rife-allegedly-told-6-year-old-his-mother-buys-his-presents-with-onlyfans-money-in-since-deleted-post.html&title=Comedian%20Matt%20Rife%20allegedly%20told%206-year-old%20his%20mother%20buys%20his%20presents%20with%20OnlyFans%20money%20in%20sin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcomedian-matt-rife-allegedly-told-6-year-old-his-mother-buys-his-presents-with-onlyfans-money-in-since-deleted-post.html&description=Comedian%20Matt%20Rife%20allegedly%20told%206-year-old%20his%20mother%20buys%20his%20presents%20with%20OnlyFans%20money%20in%20sin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./debbie-rowe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Debbie Rowe | New York Post">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-long-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Long Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
