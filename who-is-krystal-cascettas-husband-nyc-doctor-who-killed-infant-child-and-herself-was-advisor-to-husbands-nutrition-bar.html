Per the primary investigation, the police reported that on the morning of Saturday, August 5, the doctor “entered her child’s room and shot her baby and then turned the gun on herself,” per <a href=# rel=nofollow>ABC 7</a>.</p><p>The deceased doctor and her baby, whose age and sex are not revealed, lived in their Westchester home, located at Somers in New York. he New York State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) Somers revealed in a statement that “The scene is consistent with a murder/suicide.” While the mother and the child died at the scene, they left behind a bereaved husband and father, Tim Talty.</p><h2 class=split>Who is Tim Talty?</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Why are Erin Lichy and her husband Abraham being sued? 'RHONY' couple hit with $44K lawsuit</a></p><p>Tim Talty is the husband of the deceased Dr Cascetta. The couple married at a ceremony in Greenpoint, Brooklyn in 2019, and as per Daily Mail, they were living in a $1 million dollar house in the town of Somers in New York City. it is believed that the couple welcomed their baby around March of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Talty is a renowned chef and is the owner of the company named ‘<a href=# rel=nofollow>Talty Bar</a>’ that produces energy bars. Talty, 37, started his culinary journey at the age of 10. As per the company’s website, “Tim Talty’s culinary career sprouted in his parents’ kitchen, at the age of 10, where he began crafting soups and salad dressings from scratch along with an introduction to baking.” Talty graduated from Johnson and Wales and worked in several restaurants. As per his LinkedIn profile, Talty was the Lead Line Cook at Gramercy Park Hotel in 2010. He then joined Tørst in 2013 after three years of hiatus. From 2013 to 2017, Talty worked as a private chef for various companies including in an upscale restaurant under the guidance of a James Beard Award Winning Chef.</p><p>However, as the website notes, “While Tim’s culinary career was taking off, his lifelong struggle with his weight left him consistently lacking energy and feeling sluggish,” making him become health conscious and join a gym. He even lost 80 pounds. While doing so, he realized the “market was filled with underwhelming products that did not deliver” which induced him to found his own brand, ‘Talty Bar’ in 2014. The company is known to source Simple But Honest Ingredients directly from the farmers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>What does the Talty Bar website tell about Dr Cascetta?</h2><p>The Talty Bar website introduces Dr Cascetta as the approving doctor of their protein bars. In a blog titled, ‘Meet Krystal Cascetta - The doctor behind Dr Approved', for the question, “Wanna know how we can boast that Talty Bars are Doctor Approved?” they answered, “It's because Dr. Krystal Cascetta knows what's good for you!”</p><p>The website continued to eulogize Cascetta where they wrote, “The people closest to Krystal will tell you that being a doctor is in her DNA. Krystal, herself, will tell you that she has wanted to be a doctor for as long as she can remember; that even as a child she could be found wrapping her dolls in gauze.”</p><p>Sharing an anecdote, the Talty Bar family detailed her journey to become a doctor, “When Krystal was in 8th grade, her mother's best friend passed away from breast cancer. It was this life-altering event that helped Krystal decide that Medical Oncology would be her specialty.”</p><p>“Krystal is an avid runner and fitness enthusiast, who understands the needs to be fueled by clean and tasty ingredients. We are honored to have such an exceptional woman as part of the Talty Bar family,” continued the website.</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).</span><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Did Remy Ma and Papoose split?
