They almost stopped having kids after only two.</p><p class=Xg>Donny explained that Virl was born 85 percent deaf, and Tom had almost total deafness at birth. <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.abilitymagazine.com/donny_osmond_interview.html>Hearing impairments</a> appear to be a genetic problem in the Osmonds because one of Donny's nephews also has hearing problems.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Group portrait of The Osmonds in London in 1973 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Xg>The "Donnie & Marie" star confessed that, since Virl and Tom were born with disabilities, doctors and friends told George and Olive that they should stop having kids. Fortunately, they only stopped after James, their ninth.</p><p class=Xg>George and Olive decided early on that they would not treat Virl and Tom differently or lower their expectations with them. Now, they both communicate verbally and also know sign language.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>The Osmonds: Jimmy, Alan, Jay, Tom , Marie, Virl, Donny, Wayne, and Merrill on August 13, 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Xg><strong class=Vg>TOUGH LOVE FROM GEORGE</strong></p><p class=Xg>Donny and his brothers' road to stardom was not easy, but George made sure they became massive stars. Unfortunately, George's tough love wasn't always what Donny desired, especially when dating <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/20/donny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career>Debbie Glenn</a>.</p><p class=Xg>During the singer's teenage years, he started secretly dating Glenn, and by the time he was 19 years old, he was in love and wanted to marry her. George was not totally on board with that idea.</p><p class=Xg>After Donny himself told his dad that he would walk down the aisle with Glenn, George <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/20/donny-osmond-family-values-dad-marry-there-goes-career>said</a>, "Well, there goes your career." The Osmond patriarch acknowledged, though, that it was a significant milestone in Donny's personal life.</p><p class=Xg>Glenn and Donny married in 1978 and now share five kids. Donny admitted that although his dad was right about his career after tying the knot, he wouldn't change a thing because his wife "is an amazing person to be with."</p><p class=Xg>In 1982, when Donny was already too old to keep up with the boy band, he didn't want to be Donny Osmond anymore. However, he started showing that he <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/i-hated-being-me-says-former-teen-idol-donny-osmond-7246055.html>struggled with his fame</a> and career as a child.</p><p class=Xg>When he was nine years old, he was on a six-week tour of Sweden, and George was by his side. It was a very tiring schedule as Donny would play three shows a day.</p><p class=Xg>At some point, he got homesick and wrote a letter to Olive, begging her to fly to Europe and take him with her. His older brother Jay told George about the letter, and he wasn't happy. As expected, Olive didn't rescue him.</p><p class=Xg>Although Donny had a hard time dealing with fame (which he achieved thanks to George's pushy requirements), he already forgave his father. Donny <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/i-hated-being-me-says-former-teen-idol-donny-osmond-7246055.html>explained</a>:</p><p class=Xg>"[George] had a very hard life: his father died after he was born and he never knew him.
