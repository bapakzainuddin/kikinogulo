Mom entered this world on June 18, 1934, in the town of Foxford, Saskatchewan.</p><p>Rose is going to be remembered for her radiant smile, as well as her resiliency and upbeat attitude. She had a heart of knowledge and an ear that was always willing to listen to her family so that she could share her stories and experiences with them. She had a deep fondness for all of her family. She had a strong work ethic from her childhood.</p><p>Which she carried with her when she married Bill and they started their own farm while also raising their three lovely children, Bev, Betty, and Brian. Growing up in the 1930s was difficult for her, and she put in a lot of hard work throughout those years. Rose is quite knowledgeable about all aspects of farm life, including the machinery.</p><p>The crops, the animals, as well as her own flower and vegetable gardens. Rose’s talent in the kitchen was a direct result of all the time and effort she put into her career outside the home; she was an amazing cook and baker. Later on, Rose found employment at the Canadian Tire store in Saskatoon.</p><p>She was really pleased with her position there and liked it much up to the time when she reached the retirement age of 62 and went back to Prince Albert to be closer to her family. During her time spent working, she was able to meet a lot of new people and discover new interests, such as bowling, golfing, and crafting.</p><p>Rose cherished her time spent on the golf course with the other ladies at Mark’s 9 or competing against and besting her grandsons. She never missed a game and went to great lengths to ensure that she could be there to support her grandchildren no matter what sport they were playing, whether it was baseball, softball, volleyball, or soccer.</p><p>She cherished this time with them. Cinnamon buns, pies, and other baked goods were some of Rose’s favorite things to make in the kitchen. Rose was an excellent cook. It was one of her favorite things to do to have her family over to have the nicest and most extravagant lunch in her apartment, which consisted of homemade perogies, cabbage rolls, and turkey dinner. When she saw that everyone’s stomachs were full and that her family had gathered around to enjoy the meal, she would be filled with a sense of immense pride.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvs6snGaapa6ur3nOm6CtrZGnxm6%2BzqycZpqlrq6veceaqmaokajAprCMmq6asV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frose-buyan-obituary-rose-buyan-has-passed-away.html&text=Rose%20Buyan%20Obituary%2c%20Rose%20Buyan%20Has%20Passed%20Away&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frose-buyan-obituary-rose-buyan-has-passed-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frose-buyan-obituary-rose-buyan-has-passed-away.html&title=Rose%20Buyan%20Obituary%2c%20Rose%20Buyan%20Has%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frose-buyan-obituary-rose-buyan-has-passed-away.html&title=Rose%20Buyan%20Obituary%2c%20Rose%20Buyan%20Has%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frose-buyan-obituary-rose-buyan-has-passed-away.html&title=Rose%20Buyan%20Obituary%2c%20Rose%20Buyan%20Has%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frose-buyan-obituary-rose-buyan-has-passed-away.html&description=Rose%20Buyan%20Obituary%2c%20Rose%20Buyan%20Has%20Passed%20Away" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shar-jackson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shar Jackson Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Kevin Federline, Children, Film, Tv Shows, and Net Worth.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./richard-boateng-missing-swimmer-of-maryland-found-dead-in-rehoboth-beach-delaware.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard Boateng, missing swimmer of maryland, found dead in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
