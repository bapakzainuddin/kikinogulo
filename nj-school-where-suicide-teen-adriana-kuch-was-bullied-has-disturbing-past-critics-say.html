Cops were never called after the horrific assault.</p><p>The footage was widely shared on social media, and Adriana was tormented by hateful comments afterward.</p><p>She killed herself two days later, a tragedy her family blames on the school bullying.</p><p>Another teen at the school also has said that in January 2022, she was bullied and attacked in a hallway, with the assault videotaped and the footage later spread around online, as in Kuch’s case, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Fox News</a>.</p><p>That victim, who wasn’t named, sued the school in October, with her lawyer claiming she warned district officials before her attack that she&nbsp;was being threatened and harassed, yet “nothing was done.</p><p>“They didn’t call the police, they didn’t take it seriously, apparently, and sure enough these girls came through on their promise and assaulted my client,” lawyer Jonathan Ettman&nbsp; told the outlet.</p><p>The school district’s superintendent, Triantafillos Parlapanides, has&nbsp;infamously<a href=#>&nbsp;appeared to try to blame</a>&nbsp;Kuch’s suicide on her own family, claiming she was upset her dad had an “affair” and that she used drugs. He resigned Saturday.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer met with school officials after Adriana’s death. <span class=credit>Facebook/Ocean County Prosecutor's Office</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Superintendent Triantafillos Parlapanides has resigned.</figure><p>Parlapanides’s mother, reached by The Post at his home Monday, said her son wouldn’t be commenting.&nbsp;</p><p>The superintendent’s resignation came three days after Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer met with school officials for two hours over Kuch’s case, Fox News Digital reported.</p><p>Billhimer told Fox that both sides discussed “ways to improve the district’s response to incidents within the school.”</p><p>The prosecutor, asked specifically whether the closed-door meeting included talk about when the school should notify cops of violence, replied, “I can say that certainly was a topic of discussion.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Many locals took to Facebook to berate the school district for not stepping in sooner on bullying incidents. <span class=credit>Facebook/Jennifer Ferro</span></figure><p>“We discussed a number of things,” Billhimer said. “I’d like the opportunity to assist the school in implementing some of the suggestions I made, so for now I don’t want to comment any further.”</p><p>High school parent Jeff Riccardi wrote online that he’s glad Central Regional is finally feeling the heat.</p><p>“The truth is, aside from bragging about an anti-bullying policy, the school’s doing more to hide all the problems,” Riccardi<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote on Facebook.</a></p><p>He later told The Post that he thinks all schools have the same mentality.</p><p>“No one cares what happens until it’s your child,” he said.</p><p>Central Regional officials did not immediately respond to Post requests for comment on prior alleged bullying.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The disturbing beating was caught on camera.</figure><p>Some Central Regional students have posted on Facebook that they were warned by school administrators not to protest or stage a “walk-out” over the handling of Kuch’s case and other alleged incidents of bullying unless they want to risk potential suspension or detention.&nbsp;</p><p>The district put a statement on its Web site saying, “Central Regional School District is working&nbsp;in conjunction with the Berkeley Township&nbsp;Police Department to ensure school safety&nbsp;and that appropriate additional safeguards&nbsp;are in place.&nbsp;</p><p>“The District recognizes and&nbsp;appreciates the public’s right to protest.&nbsp;However any protests cannot disrupt&nbsp;school services during school hours.”</p><p class=postsid
