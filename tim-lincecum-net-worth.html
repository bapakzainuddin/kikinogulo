Previously, he played for the San Francisco Giants (2007-2015). He is considered to be one of the best pitchers in the history of baseball. His career has been active since 2006.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Tim Lincecum is? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Tim counts his net worth at the impressive amount of $40 million as of mid- 2016; his salary per year is now apparently $22.25 million. Obviously, the main source of this sum of money is coming from his successful career in the sports industry as a professional baseball player.</p><h3>Tim Lincecum Net Worth $40 Million</h3><p>Tim Lincecum was raised with his older brother by their mother, Rebecca Asis, and their father, Chris Lincecum, who was an ex-baseball pitcher. While attending Liberty Senior High School in Renton, Washington, he distinguished himself as a baseball player, which led him to being named Washington State’s player of the year.

He finished his college career with a 12–4 win-loss record, and he won the 2006 Golden Spikes Award for best amateur baseball player. After college, he became an amateur player for the National Baseball Congress (NBC) Seattle Studs, and excelled in becoming NBC Graduate of the Year.</p><p>Before his professional playing career began in 2006, he was drafted in 2003 and in 2005 but preferred to complete his education; however, he entered the 2006 Draft and was selected as the 10th overall pick by the San Francisco Giants, and his net worth increased immediately from the contract he signed with the Giants, which worth was $2 million. However, he stayed in Minor Baseball League only two seasons, until 2007, and for that time he was named as the best pitcher in the team.</p><p>In 2007, as the Giants’ starter was injured, and Tim made his debut in the Major League playing against the Philadelphia Phillies; in his first career game, he had three strke-outs, and in his first season with the Giants Tim had a fantastic numbers, but was brought down to the bench by the head coach, as he was afraid that Tim would become prone to injuries in his later career. Tim continued successfully in his second season, and in 2011 earned a spot in the All-Star game.</p><p>He played for the Giants until 2015, winning numerous accolades as an individual as well as with the team, which only increased further his overall net worth. With the Giants, Tim won three World Series Championships, and was selected four times for the All-Star game. Furthermore, he won the Babe Ruth Award in 2010, and won two NL CY Young Awards in 2008 and 2009. Also, Tim was the NL strikeout leader three times in a row, in 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p><p>In 2016, he signed a contract worth $2.5 million with the Los Angeles of Anaheim, and since then has played for them; however, his numbers are nowhere near the ones he had while being a part of the Giants.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Tim Lincecum is currently still single and his residence is in Sausalito, California.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.702657807309><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tim Lincecum</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$40 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$2.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 15, 1984</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Bellevue, Washington, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.8034 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>175 lbs (79.37 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball player, Athlete</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Liberty High School, University of Washington</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Chris Lincecum, Rebecca Lincecum</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Sean Lincecum</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>The Freak , The Franchise</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/TimLincecum</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3081838/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>National League Cy Young Award</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award, Best Championship Performance ESPY Award</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Long Hair</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=6.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>In June 2014, he joined Christy Mathewson as the only Giants to throw two no-hitters.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Prior to the 2013 season, he cut off his trademark long hair.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>Pitcher with the San Francisco Giants, 2007-present.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Made major league debut on 6 May 2007.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Won Cy Young Awards for 2008 and 2009.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Official 2010 World Series Film</td><td>2010</td><td></td><td>Tim Lincecum</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=3.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sunday Night Baseball</td><td>2007-2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself -
