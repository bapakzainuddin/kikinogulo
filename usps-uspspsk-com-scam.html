This scam has affected customers in both the United Kingdom and the United States.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Smishing_Messages_and_Fake_Websites></span>Smishing Messages and Fake Websites<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Smishing messages are fraudulent text messages that are designed to trick recipients into providing personal and financial information. In the case of the Usps Uspspsk Com Scam, individuals have reported receiving smishing messages from various phone numbers claiming to be from USPS.</p><p>These messages often contain links to the fake website Usps.usspsk.com. The website is designed to mimic the official USPS website, making it difficult for users to distinguish between the real and fake sites.</p><p>Once on the fake website, users are prompted to input their contact details, including credit card information, and are asked to make a small payment. However, even if users input incorrect or redundant information, the website still accepts the details and requests payment.</p><p>It is important to note that the small payment requested is usually less than $1 and is likely a ploy to place authorization charges on credit cards. This allows the scammers behind Usps.usspsk.com to obtain credit card details and personal information from unsuspecting victims.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Features_and_Legitimacy_of_Uspsusspskcom></span>Features and Legitimacy of Usps.usspsk.com<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Usps.usspsk.com is a high-end scam that utilizes web page designs that closely resemble the official USPS website. The scammers behind this scheme have gone to great lengths to make the fake website appear legitimate.</p><p>The website uses services provided by Linkflyâ€™s platform, which generates encrypted links for marketing and promotional purposes. This allows the scammers to share the fraudulent website across various platforms.</p><p>Despite its fraudulent nature, Usps.usspsk.com has implemented certain features to make it appear more legitimate. For example, the website uses a secured HTTPS protocol, which gives the impression of a secure connection. However, it is important to note that this does not guarantee the legitimacy of the website.</p><p>When examining the legitimacy of Usps.usspsk.com, several red flags emerge. The website has a terrible trust score of 1%, indicating that it is a high-risk website for financial transactions and the security of usersâ€™ personal and payment data.</p><p>Additionally, the domain authority of Usps.usspsk.com is only 1 out of 100, and it has a zero Alexa ranking. These factors further suggest that the website is not trustworthy.</p><p>Furthermore, the website was registered in a high-risk country, China, and the registrar of the website, Alibaba.Com Singapore E-Commerce Private Limited, is known to be associated with scammers.</p><p>Given these factors, it is clear that Usps.usspsk.com is a fraudulent website that should be avoided. It is important to refrain from accessing the website and providing any personal or payment information.</p><p>If you have received smishing messages or have fallen victim to this scam, it is recommended to report the incident to the appropriate authorities and take steps to protect your personal and financial information.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dummy_Pages_and_Small_Dollar_Payments></span>Dummy Pages and Small Dollar Payments<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pcrisk.com/images/stories/screenshots202104/usps-rewards-scam-main.jpg alt="Dummy Pages and Small Dollar Payments" width=790 height=557 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As part of the Usps Uspspsk Com Scam, the fake website Usps.usspsk.com utilizes dummy pages and small dollar payments to deceive users and obtain their personal and financial information.</p><p>When users visit Usps.usspsk.com, they are presented with dummy pages that mimic the genuine USPS re-delivery registration requests. These pages offer to redeliver packages without requiring users to authenticate their delivery address.</p><p>One concerning aspect of the scam is that users can input any redundant details, any combination of characters, and any combination of numbers in the contact details field, and the website still accepts these details. This means that even if users provide incorrect or nonsensical information, the website proceeds to request a small dollar payment via credit card.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Credit_Card_Details_and_Personal_Information></span>Credit Card Details and Personal Information<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>By requesting small dollar payments, typically less than $1, Usps.usspsk.com aims to trick users into providing their credit card details. The scammers behind the website use this tactic to obtain sensitive financial information and personal data from unsuspecting victims.</p><p>It is important to note that providing your credit card details on a fraudulent website like Usps.usspsk.com can have serious consequences. Scammers can use this information for unauthorized transactions, identity theft, or other fraudulent activities.</p><p>If you have unknowingly provided your credit card details or personal information on Usps.usspsk.com or any other suspicious website, it is crucial to take immediate action to protect yourself. Contact your bank or credit card company to report the incident and request a card replacement if necessary. Additionally, monitor your financial statements and credit reports regularly to identify any unauthorized activity.</p><p>Remember, legitimate organizations like USPS will never ask you to provide sensitive information or make small payments through unofficial channels. Stay vigilant and be cautious when sharing personal and financial details online.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Uspsusspskcom_Details_and_Trust_Score></span>Usps.usspsk.com Details and Trust Score<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Examining the details of Usps.usspsk.com provides further insight into the nature of the scam and its trustworthiness. Several factors contribute to the overall assessment of the websiteâ€™s legitimacy.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Server_Information_and_Traffic_Value></span>Server Information and Traffic Value<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Usps.usspsk.com relays its services using a server with the serial number 912b084acf0c18a753f6d62e25a75f5a. The website targets the nameservers ns8.alidns.com (39.96.153.48) and ns7.alidns.com (39.96.153.47), which are located in China, a high-risk country.</p><p>It is worth noting that the ISP of Usps.usspsk.com is Tencent Cloud Computing (Beijing) Co. Ltd, which has been associated with hosting several suspicious websites in the past.</p><p>When it comes to traffic value, Usps.usspsk.com has an average of zero visitors per month, resulting in a traffic value of $0. This indicates that the website does not receive significant organic traffic or engagement.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Registration_and_IP_Details></span>Registration and IP Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Usps.usspsk.com was registered and updated just two days prior to the discovery of the scam, on October 16th, 2023. The registration was done in China, further raising concerns about the websiteâ€™s legitimacy.</p><p>The registrar of Usps.usspsk.com is Alibaba.Com Singapore E-Commerce Private Limited, a company that has been associated with scammers in the past. This adds to the suspicion surrounding the website.</p><p>The IP address of Usps.usspsk.com is 170.106.196.132, and it has a Low-Domain Validated Certificate (DV-SSL) issued by Letâ€™s Encrypt. The certificate is valid for the next 89 days, but it is important to note that this does not guarantee the trustworthiness of the website.</p><p>It is crucial to consider these details and the overall trust score of Usps.usspsk.com when assessing the legitimacy of the website. With a terrible trust score of 1%, a low domain authority of 1/100, and a zero Alexa ranking, it is evident that the website is highly suspicious and poses a significant risk to usersâ€™ personal and payment data.</p><p>Given these findings, it is strongly advised to avoid accessing Usps.usspsk.com and refrain from providing any personal or payment information on the website. Protecting your online security and privacy should always be a top priority.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In conclusion, it is clear that Usps.usspsk.com is a fraudulent website involved in the Usps Uspspsk Com Scam.

This is the legitimate platform for scheduling re-delivery of packages and accessing USPS services. Any other website claiming to be affiliated with USPS, such as Usps.usspsk.com, should be treated with extreme caution.</p><p>Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that scammers behind Usps.usspsk.com have included genuine social media links of USPS, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube, on their fraudulent website.

However, it is important to remember that legitimate USPS communications and transactions should be conducted through the official USPS website and verified social media accounts.</p><p>To protect yourself from falling victim to scams like the Usps Uspspsk Com Scam, it is crucial to remain vigilant and exercise caution when sharing personal and financial information online. Be wary of unsolicited messages, especially those requesting payment or sensitive data.</p><p>If you have encountered the Usps Uspspsk Com Scam or have any suspicions about the legitimacy of a website or communication claiming to be from USPS, it is recommended to report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
