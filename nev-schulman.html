Furthermore, in an exclusive interview with People's Magazine, he characterized his wife, Laura, as the lady of his dreams. On July 22, 2017, the beautiful pair married in a traditional ceremony attended by close friends and family in his father's garden in East Hampton, New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/25/184024519_792541575020310_3932172635986167329_n-min%20(1)-1632580943805.jpg><p>The lovely couple also has beautiful kids. Their first child is <strong>Cleo James </strong>who was born on October 21, 2016. The couple revealed in August 2018 that they were expecting their second kid, a baby boy. On January 9, 2019, Perlongo gave birth to the couple's second kid, <strong>Beau Bobby Bruce</strong>.</p><p>On September 26, 2021, Schulman and his spouse Laura <a href=# rel=nofollow>welcomed their third child</a> and the latest member of their family; a baby boy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nev Schulman's Net Worth</h2><p>Nev Schulman has an <a href=# rel=nofollow>estimated net worth</a> of <strong>$500,000</strong>, the majority of which stems from his tenure at MTV. Most famously, he is an independent film producer, which is how he created the picture <i>Catfish</i>, but MTV is what brought him global attention. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cheryl Howard</a> is one of the talented and hard-working actresses of Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/25/129790304_220992306065654_5400997990463452075_n-min%20(1)-1632581072288.jpg><p>Before this, The hard-working actor authored and released a book in 2014. The book, titled <i>Life: Love, Lies, and Identity in the Digital Age,</i> covers Schulman's personal experience as well as what he's learned from dealing with couples on the program. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Paige Howard</a> has a total asset of over <strong>$17.1 million</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wiki-Bio</h2><p>Nev Schulman was born on <i>September 26, 1984</i>, in New York City to his parents. <strong>Yaniv Schulman</strong> is his actual name. The <i>Catfish host </i>grew up with his younger brother <a href=#><strong>Ariel</strong> <strong>Schulman</strong></a><strong>, </strong>who is also an actor and filmmaker. He is of mixed ethnic background (German Jews, Russian Jews, Poles, and Romanian Jews).</p><p>Before this, Schulman began shooting photographs and got interested in photography after five years of studying dance. In addition, from 2004 to 2006, he attended Sarah Lawrence College, where he studied Photography and Dance. He does, however, confess to being expelled from Sarah Lawrence College for striking a female student.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/25/123775221_365269781198260_7301454274189481763_n-min%20(1)-1632581117722.jpg><p>However, Nev Schulman got his big break in <i>2010 </i>when the documentary Catfish, created by his production company, went viral. The concept of the documentary is centered on Schulman meeting a girl online with whom he ultimately falls in love. However, he soon discovers that she is not what she seems to be. Catfish was subsequently adapted into a television series by MTV in <i>2012</i>, titled Catfish: The TV Show. Schulman served as both the project's host and executive producer.</p><p><i>Catfish </i>earned Nev Schulman and his co-host Max Joseph a Teen Choice Award nomination in 2014 for Choice TV Personality: Male. Since then, he has also written a book titled In Real Life: Lies & Identity in the Digital Age, released in <i>2014</i>.
