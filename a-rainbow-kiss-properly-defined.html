The Rainbow kiss is the latest barometer that will be used by couples as a yardstick to truly judge if their partner wholly accepts their positive and negatives and how far he or she is willing to go to increase their intimacy and expose themselves to possible new pleasure that has not yet been cultivated.</p><p>The Rainbow kiss brings about the rawest form of self-manifestation as it regards what a man and a woman will truly share in the bedroom where no one else is. The Rainbow kiss gives a man the opportunity to assure his partner of possible insecurities and how far he is willing to go to reassure her that he will go the extra mile to make sure that her deepest desires are fully satisfied. For a woman, the rainbow kiss makes sure that the man is committed to adventure and pleasure sharing intimacy with her.
