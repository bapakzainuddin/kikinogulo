Moreover, he has amassed more than one million followers, mostly due to audiences liking towards his portrayal of&nbsp;an airhead&nbsp;character named Brick Armstrong. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>After all, audiences are&nbsp;well known for his famous stints in various episodes. For instance, in one of the episodes of the show, he covers up the word "gay " when asked to cover up slur at the wall of the local LGBT center as part of community service. The episode did shed light on the challenges the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> gay</a> community faces from the level of stereotypical understanding of the word gay itself.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Interestingly though, life outside of screen hadn't been so significant in the actor's life, at least in the arena of relationship. But as time moved one, some small details started coming forward. See for yourself.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Mysterious Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Michael had&nbsp;been a very shy and secretive one when it came to sharing details on his love life. For fans, it was hard to believe that despite his fame, cute looks, and blazing muscle packed body, he remained single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Delta Goodrem Splits From Boyfriend :-</strong> <a href=# rel=follow>Joins The ‘Single’ Community</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Not that he ever confirmed he was single, and instead, he remained mum about his relationship status. On the other hand, it was improbable that he was single. However, his fans worldwide kept solace in the fact that he wasn't off the market, and his shirtless figure was more than enough to turn in a few eyes.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Interestingly though, in 2018, he did surprise his fans with a hint on his possible girlfriend. On 15th February that year, he shared a picture through his Insta handle featuring a girl ( unfortunately only the hair was visible) looking at a classic painting. Furthermore, he captioned the picture writing "valentine," and this was enough to raise many eyes in the media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Michael Provost's mysterious girlfriend as seen from his Insta post on 15th February 2019 </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Michael Provost's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yes! It appeared that the Saving Zoe star had a company with him a day before he posted the picture (on Valentine's day). But with more reveal, came more questions. Who was the girl? When did he start dating her? Well, there were no answers to any of these <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>For now. all that can be speculated is his partner has a knack for art, or perhaps she is an art connoisseur.</p><p style=text-align:justify>On top of that, it's unknown if the artist is still together with her: let alone any news of&nbsp;major developments in&nbsp;their relationship. So, all that's known about his lowkey love life is that Michael didn't spend 2018's valentine's day all by himself. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Age, Parents, Siblings</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Michael's( height of&nbsp;5 feet &&nbsp;8 inches i,e,1.73&nbsp;meters )date of birth as per verified records falls on 24th January 1998, whereas his birthplace is Atlanta, Georgia. He possesses a mixed ethnicity as&nbsp;he is of French, Canadian, Scottish, and Irish descent.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Michael Provost as seen posing shirtless for Extinction Rebellion movement on 15th May 2019</strong> (Photo: Michael Provost's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>While there are some parents who remain very firm on deciding strictly on their children's career, thankfully, his parents were not one of those. When the 21-year-old star, starting showing his enthusiasm for acting, his father and mother remained very supportive of him. Moreover, to support his acting dreams, his parents moved to Los Angeles, where he had better prospects as an artist.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Talking about his siblings, the TV icon has four brothers altogether, and he&nbsp;is the third eldest among them.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Movies</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Michael has mostly stuck to working for TV shows, but that doesn't mean he hasn't been involved in movie projects yet. At a young age of 13, he made his onscreen debut by working in a short movie titled Anonymous and continued working on other short films.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Career Start From Short Film:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Sarah Gilman Dating, Parents, Family, Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Later on, in 2014, he got his first break on a major movie titled Hear No Evil.&nbsp;Likewise, he started acting on less known titles such as Reality High, The Case For Christ, and Saving Zoe.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, he has more movie projects lined up for the coming years as he will be appearing in films such as Fear Street 2 and An Innocent Kiss slated to be released in 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqahk52upriMqamorp%2BowW6zyKujn6qZmrulecOaq6Kml2K0osWNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-provost-girlfriend-dating-gay-html.html&text=Michael%20Provost%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Gay&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-provost-girlfriend-dating-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-provost-girlfriend-dating-gay-html.html&title=Michael%20Provost%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-provost-girlfriend-dating-gay-html.html&title=Michael%20Provost%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-provost-girlfriend-dating-gay-html.html&title=Michael%20Provost%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-provost-girlfriend-dating-gay-html.html&description=Michael%20Provost%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./231866-nia-longs-8-year-old-son-poses-braids-cl-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nia Long's 8-Year-Old Son Poses with Braids in Close-up Photo Showing He Has Mom's Brown Eyes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-maude-desgagne-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Know Everything About The French Singer Sarah Maude Desgagn">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
