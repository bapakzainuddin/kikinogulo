His professional playing career has been active since 2008.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Chris Long is, as of early 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Chris’ net worth is over $28 million, accumulated through his successful involvement in the sports industry as a professional football player.</p><h3>Chris Long Net Worth $28 Million</h3><p>Chris Long spent his childhood with two younger brothers in his hometown, the sons of <a href=#>Howie Long</a>, a former professional football player and a Pro Football Hall of Fame member; his brothers are Kyle Long and Howie Long, Jr., both of them involved in the sports industry. He went to St. Anne’s-Belfield Academy in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he became active in playing football, and in his senior year led the team to win the state UIL school championship, and participated at the 2004 US Army All-American Bowl. Upon matriculation, he enrolled in the University of Virginia to study Sociology, where he continued to play football for the Virginia Caveliers college team. He distinguished himself as a player so was named captain of the team, and earned second-team All-ACC honors. As a senior player, with his 8.3 tackles per game he became a unanimous First-team All-American. During the same year, he won the Hendricks Award, Dudley Award as well as the ACC Defensive Player of the Year.</p><p>In no time, Chris’ professional playing career began, when he was selected in the first round of the 2008 NFL Draft as the 2nd overall pick by the St. Louis Rams, signing a contract worth $56.5 million over the next six years, which marked the beginning of his net worth. He made his debut in the game against the New York Giants, and made the first sack of his career, continuing in the same vein to be named to the NFL All-Rookie Team at the end of the season. His next major success came in 2010, when he recorded two sacks in the match against the San Diego Chargers, which earned him the NFC Defensive Player of the Week. During the following year, he won the NFL Alumni Lineman of the Year award, so in 2012, Chris’ contract was extended for the following four years, which was worth $50 million, adding a considerable amount to his net worth. In the same year, he led the team with 50 hurries, 24 quarterback hits and 11.5 sacks. During his time at the Rams, he was named for the first time in his career to the US Football’s All-Fundamentals Team. However, he suffered a leg injury and was unable to play until 2015, when he appeared in 12 games, and finally in 2016 was released from the team.</p><p>Subsequently, Chris became a member of the New England Patriots, signing a one-year contract worth $2 million. He played every game including with the team in winning the AFC Championship and Super Bowl LI, the first NFL championship trophy for him, which increased his potential net worth by a large margin.</p><p>To speak further about his career, Chris has now signed a new professional contract over the next two years with the Philadelphia Eagles, as of March of 2017. Most recently, he appeared with the team when they won Super Bowl LII, against The Patriots! His net worth is certainly still rising.</p><p>If to talk about his personal life, Chris Long has been married to Megan O’Malley, who played for the UVa women’s lacrosse team, since 2013; the couple has a son together. Their current residence is in Charlottesville, Virginia. He is also known for establishing his own charity called The Chris Long Foundation, which helps in sinking wells for drinking water, for people in Africa. Furthermore, he announced in 2017 that all his salary from the next season would be donated to charitable organizations.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.4350649350649><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chris Long</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$28 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 28, 1985</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santa Monica, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.91 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>125 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football player</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>St. Anne's-Belfield Academy, University of Virginia, Virginia Caveliers College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Megan O'Malley</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Waylon James Long</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Howie Long, Diane Addonizio</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Kyle Long, Howard Long, Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/joel9one</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/laflamablanca95</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2988674</a></td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Heisman Trophy</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1.3660714285714><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2.7196261682243><td>1</td><td>Son of Hall of Fame NFL defensive end / Fox NFL Sunday Analyst <a href=#>Howie Long</a> and Diane Long (née Addonizio).</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Ballers</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Chris Long</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Russillo & Kanell</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Game Changers</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Good Morning America</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself -
